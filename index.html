        "We push each other to be the best. It's not uncommon for one of us to
        say 'this needs to be better, back to the drawing board"
      </p>
      <p>- Bryan Teddy, lead vocalist of the Bees Knees</p>
      <h3>The Bees Knees</h3>
      <p>
        The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco,
        California. The band consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy, guitarist
        Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist Kent Zulkee and drummer
        Freddie Fischer. The band achieved its first commercial success as an
        unsigned act, drawing attention from manager Cam Adams. Having worked
        with other popular acts (The Elephant In The Room, One Trick Pony, The
        Cat’s Meow), Adams was confident the band could succeed even further,
        pushing them to sign with Magenta Records.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition and
        ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately fell in
        love with the band’s original and organic attitude, solidifying their
        place as one of the hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this
        century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are
        drawn to their candid and authentic performances on stage. Looking
        forward to touring in the future, The Bees Knees are currently recording
        their second studio album, looking to be released in late 2021.
